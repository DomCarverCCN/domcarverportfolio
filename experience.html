										<h3>My Experience...<i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>
										<p><strong>Local Paperound - 2013/2015</strong> </p>
										<p>I got my first job at the age of 13, delivering local papers. It was a one day a week job, which I did for 2 years before moving on.
											Being such a simple job, not many skills were learnt, and it was just for a little cash as a teenager, however it did help to give me a 
											sense of time keeping, and some communication skills if ever I saw a customer.</p>

										<p><strong>Kiosk Assistant (Norwich City Football Club) 2015/2016</strong><p>

										<p>This was my second part-time job that I had, which involved preperation and time keeping before a busy matchday at my local Football Club.
											This was my first taste of a proper job, which allowed me to gain far more skills. Time keeping was a key skill that I learnt, as we had to ensure that the area and Kiosk were all prepred ready for supporters to buy food and drink from, before and at half-time. We also had to ensure the kiosk was cleaned and ready for the next match, before the end of our shift. This part-time job also allowed me to gain far better communication and customer service skills, when serving customers, and ensuring the customer is happy. It also required you to be a fast learner, as on a matchday, you don't have time to slowly learn skills, so you need to learn them as you go, under pressure.</p>

											<p><strong>Work Experience (Norwich City FC, IT Department (2015 - 1 week)</strong><p>

										<p>This was my first experience of what an office work place is like, so I was very eager to get started here. It was a very interesting and productive week, where I was able to learn about some of the software and programs that the department use to essentially all the IT at the club. 
											<ul>
											<li>With the IT Technician I spent time preparing for a game against West Bromwich Albion by prepping all the turnstiles to ensure that all fans using access control cards would have smooth entry into the stadium. I also helped with pre match checks on the PC’s and printers on the counters in the Ticket Office to ensure efficiency on match day</li>
											<li>I built ten new laptops ready for use, downloading and installing all of the relevant software required to enable them to be handed out to users</li>
											<li>I assisted the Senior Technician with raising PO’s and Goods Receiving on the Purchase and Stock Control system – Eatec. I also assisted making changes to the websites</li>
											<li>Helping input data into the CRM/Ticketing System was one of my main roles during the week. The data is collected in the restaurants when customers complete ‘bill fold’ cards and is input manually into the CRM system enabling staff to enter them into Norwich City’s Birthday Club and make sure they receive any offers they may have</li>
											<li>Assisted in writing and running reports from the IBM I Series server (CRM) for the email marketing campaigns</li>
											<li>Also while there I was introduced to some of the different software the Club uses such as:</li>
											<br />Artifax: used for Conference and Banqueting bookings and diary
											<br />Dotmailer: used for sending our email campaigns
											<br />Meraki: used for tracking our mobile devices
  </p>

										<p><strong>General Sales Assistant (Matalan) 2016/Present</strong></p>

										<p>I am currently working at the retail shop, Matalan. I have been working here for 7 months and I have gained skills that I did not have already. As well as time keeping, fast learning, communication and customer service skills that I already learnt from previous jobs, I have managed to pick up some more skills working here. I was orignally employed as a general sales assistant, which mainly meant I would be on tills, serving customers, however throughout the months I have varied between many different jobs. At times I would need to take care of several jobs at once, which involves multi-tasking but precision to ensure jobs are still completed to the correct standard. This job has also allowed me to have far more responsibility, when I have been in charge of leading newer members of staff on the shop floor, or bringing a daily delivery into the stockroom ready to be processed and unpackaged the same day.</p>
										
										<p><strong>Work Experience (Norwich City FC, IT Department (2016 - 4 days)</strong><p>

										<p>This was the second time returning to the Football Club for work experience, and I was expecting to re-apply my skills and remind myself of the work place environment. As well as doing both of these things I also spent some time shadowing people in the department, seeing some of the tasks they have to complete on a daily basis. At this point I also knew that I wanted to follow a career in Design/Digital Marketing, so I spent a day in the social media and design department. This was particularly intersting to me, as it was I'm mainly focusing on. I was able to see some of the software that they use, and how they create some of the artwork via videos and images that are published to their social media pages for thousands of people to see. When with the social media team I learnt some of the analytic software they use, and how closely they have to follow it all when posting new content. This especially helped for pointing me in the direction of digital marketing. 
											It was a very productive and interesting few days spent back at the club.</p>
